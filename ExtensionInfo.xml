  <!-- You can reference songs from the original game here, or your own .ogg files by path.
  To reference original songs, use their name in the files! You don't need the path, just the filename. This works for any songs in these folders:
  Content/Music
  Content/DLC/Music
  
  To Play your own songs, use the path to that song in your extension.
  For example, try changing the song name below to "Music/Chemical_Burns.ogg" - it'll start with that instead for new saves! -->

  <WorkshopDescription>故事线发生在keep trying之后 身为玩家的你接收到了一封来自Zero的邀请函，那么接下来的故事又会有怎样的展开呢？
  The story happens after the story of Keep Trying. As for a Player,you received a invitation from Zero. So what will happen next? Explore it by yourself!
  
  keep trying 2 设置有3个结局 分别是伪完美结局 disconnect线 真相篇结局 我个人推荐是按伪完美结局 disconnect线 真相篇结局这样的顺序来
  keep trying 2 has 3 ends: The Perfect Ending(fake) Disconnect and the True Ending. You can finish it by yourself.
  
  游戏特色：难度较高、解谜有点烧脑、剧情还行、音乐也还行
  This extension is high difficulty and it is hard to solve the puzzle.
  
  游玩时间: 3-4 h一个结局
  It will take you 3-4 hours to finish an ending
  
  At last, I am so sorry that my poor English. I can't translate it in English by myself.
  So the extension language is Chinese.

  <!-- Path to the preview image used on the steam workshop for your extension.
  This must be within your mod folder, be 16x9 aspect ratio and less than 1MB in size. 
  I recommend the highest resolution you can provide that fits that criteria, 
  though steam will likely use a version less than 512x512 in size, and will auto resize it for you.
  
  This can be different to the provided Logo.png if you want, as this will not be transparently backed on steam.
  Supported formats are .png, .jpg and .gif

  <!-- This is the workshop publish ID. The first time your extension is published to Steam, this will be automatically populated with the ID that steam assigns it.
  When this happens, make sure that you keep that version of the file and store the ID somewhere - without it, you wont be able to push out updates to your extension,
  and if it's removed, publishing to the workshop will submit it as a new entry, and you'll lose all of your subscribers. Be careful!
  Do not manually modify this unless you already know your Publish ID from a previous submission. A new ID will only be generated if this says "NONE"-->
