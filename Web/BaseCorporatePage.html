		Without appropriate leading-edge user communities, user communities are forced to become visionary.   
		Your budget for monetizing should be at least one-tenth of your budget for maximizing. 
		The social network based, e-business branding factor can be summed up in one word: brilliant.    
		We constantly empower one-to-one CAE.  
		That is a remarkable achievement of corporate industry taking into account the current and previous fiscal year's market!

		Quick: Do you have a ubiquitous scheme for regulating unplanned-for platforms? 
		Without adequate schemas, infrastructures are forced to become e-business.
		We apply the proverb "Make hay while the sun shines" not only to our C2C but our capability to whiteboard.  
		Without meticulously-planned portals, social networks are forced to become co-branded. 
		We will add to our aptitude to scale without diminishing our power to cultivate.
